    <h3>Home page (Dance like a professional)</h3>
    <p>
        Here at Dirt Road Country Dance we are focused on the cause of making you become the best country dancer you can be. 
We cover everything here, from the basic moves for a beginner to advanced moves, dips, and lifts, but even more than just the moves, 
we teach you how to use them so that you can look like a professional while you dance.

    </ul>
    <h3>Live Lessons</h3>
    <p>
        No one can learn country dance very well by themselves, so we look to provide times where you can meet up with our 
instructors and other peers to better learn and perfect your moves. If you can’t manage to meet with us in person, 
that’s okay! We have online sessions where you can ask about anything that doesn’t make sense to you or that doesn’t 
seem to work very well, and our instructors can answer and demonstrate moves for you in real time.

    </ul>
    <h3>Learning database</h3>
    <p>
        We have a sizeable database of country dance moves that you can learn or review at home, as well as a series of mini lessons 
covering the basics as well as some advanced tactics. We explain how the different moves can work together, and how you can modify 
them for different beats and styles of country dance. While actually dancing is the best way to get better, this is a close second.
